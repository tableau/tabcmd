# We are varying the gettext process a little because we want to
# re-use the existing translated strings in the old client
# manually annotate each string and use a string id
# manually generate a template file with id -> original string
# check in properties files from the monolith in all languages
# automate: two properties files -> po http://docs.translatehouse.org/projects/translate-toolkit/en/latest/commands/prop2po.html
# gettext or Babel : po -> mo during packaging  (https://www.mattlayman.com/blog/2015/i18n/)
# strings in template that are not in .properties should remain in English?


# These outcome reporting lines were all returned from the server in clientxml

# how much of this can be replaced by server responses?
