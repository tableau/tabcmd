Tableau provides the tabcmd command-line interface that you can use to automate site administration tasks on your Tableau Cloud or Tableau Server site. For example, you can use tabcmd to create or delete users, projects, and groups.
This new version of tabcmd supports signing in with both Personal Access Tokens and passwords.

## Logging in

You can log in to the tabcmd CLI in one of four ways. Users on Tableau Cloud or Tableau Server with multi-factor authentication (MFA) must use the personal access token (PAT) method.

  * Log in with `--username` but not `--password`, and tabcmd prompts for the password to be entered 

  * Log in using `--passwordfile` instead of `--password`

  * Log in with a personal access token (PAT)

  * Log in with `--password` and the password value listed in the command line. This is the simplest way to log in but it is the least secure and not recommended.

<div class="alert alert-info">
<strong>Tip</strong>: If your password or PAT has <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter">delimiters</a> or certain special characters, the command line might not correctly send your password or PAT to the server. These characters must be escaped. 

Special characters can be:

* comma (,)
* semicolon (;)
* equals (=)
* space ( )
* tab (    )
* plus (+)
* semi-colon (;)
* ellipsis (...)

The escape character to use depends on your operating system (OS). For example, the caret (^) is an escape character on Windows. To use the caret, you must escape it with itself (^) or by enclosing in double quotes. For example: 

    --username "tom^harry"
    --username tom^^harry

## Examples
The following command demonstrates starting a session:

```shell
tabcmd login -s <https://online.tableau.com> -t mysite -u authority@email.com -p password
```

Here’s how to start a session and delete a workbook with one command. You don’t need login here:

```shell
tabcmd delete "Sales_Workbook" -s <https://online.tableau.com> -t campaign -u admin@email.com -p password
```

The options -s, -t, -u, and -p are among the tabcmd global variables, which can be used with any command.

For more information, see [tabcmd Commands](tabcmd_cmd).

## Log file
Full log information is written to the `tabcmd.log` file. This file is included in the directory where the tabcmd program is running.
