## Addressing Implicit Bias in Technical Language
In an effort to align with one of our core company values, equality, we have changed terminology to be more inclusive where possible. Because changing terms in code can break current implementations, we maintain the current terminology in the following places:

- Tableau APIs: methods, parameters, and variables
- Tableau CLIs: commands and options
- Installers, installation directories, and terms in configuration files
- Tableau Resource Monitoring Tool (we plan to make changes to non-inclusive terminology in the web interface, error messages, and related documentation soon.)
- Third-party systems documentation

For more information about our ongoing effort to address implicit bias, see [Salesforce Updates Technical Language in Ongoing Effort to Address Implicit Bias](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/salesforce-updates-technical-language-in-ongoing-effort-to-address-implicit-bias) on the Salesforce website.
