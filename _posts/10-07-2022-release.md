title:  "Tableau tabcmd 2 - Release for general use (Tableau Online functionality)"
abstract: "The new Python tabcmd command-line utility is now available for Tableau Online users"
---

[On June 10, we published version 1.99.99](https://github.com/tableau/tabcmd/releases/tag/v1.99.99) of the tabcmd command-line utility, for general usage by Tableau Online customers. The 1.99 versioning indicates that it has not yet seen widespread usage, and we expected to find some remaining bugs. 

On September 12, we published an updated [version 2.06](https://github.com/tableau/tabcmd/releases/tag/v2.0.6), that fixed several issues discovered in the 1.99 version and lists a few remaining not-yet-implemented features:
* when logging in to a server, you must specify http or https with the url and you must specify the exact url (e.g https://10ax.online.tableau.com, not just online.tableau.com)
* custom views are not supported in any operations
* get/export size parameters are not respected, and filtering for any parameter with spaces in the names does not work
* refresh-extracts does not support incremental refresh, asynchronous refresh, or adding/removing calculations for an extract
* run schedule is not supported
* a few command options like --no-complete are not yet supported

It also features a new command, to help users navigate the server content

Note that we are still targeting Online functionality, so operations that are only available in Tableau Server may also not yet be implemented. To see updates on available functionality, see the [releases](https://github.com/tableau/tabcmd/releases) page.

Both versions are available to users on Windows, macOS, or Linux to install using *pip* on the command line, or to download as an executable for windows, or to download as a source code zip for users on windows, mac or linux. 

We expect to make executable files for macOS and Linux available in future releases.
