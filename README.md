# Tabcmd

[![Tableau Supported](https://img.shields.io/badge/Support%20Level-Tableau%20Supported-53bd92.svg)](https://www.tableau.com/support-levels-it-and-developer-tools)

A Python based app that replicates the functionality of the existing [Tabcmd command line utility](https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/tabcmd.htm).

**Important Note:** tabcmd is a work in progress ("beta") which may be useful for test and development purposes, but is not yet recommended for production environments.

## Why a Python based Tabcmd?

* Run Tabcmd commands on MacOS (existing Tabcmd does not officially support MacOS)
* Authenticate using Personal Access Tokens (existing Tabcmd does not support Personal Access Token login)
* Easily use public endpoints available in Python based [Tableau Server Client](https://github.com/tableau/server-client-python/)
* Add more functionality and extend script for other automation tasks
